### Startup-Venture-Funding-Visualization
#### Software used: Tableau Prep, Tableau Desktop
#### Project Goal
A startup is a young company founded by one or more entrepreneurs in order to develop a unique product or service and bring it to market. By its nature, the typical startup tends to be a shoestring operation, with initial funding from the founders or their families. This is where venture capital plays a major role. The project aims to create an interactive visualization platform, using Tableau that allows users to learn and obtain insights regarding the fund-raising activity of startup firms.
